<b><u>Introduction</u></b>
<p>
&quot;Uncle Jacques, &quot; you ask, &quot;What's for dinner?&quot;
<p>
&quot;Ask me again in 10 minutes, &quot; Uncle Jacques replies, eyeing the weary-looking frog sitting on the shoulder of Interstate 10, in front of your dilapidated shack.
<p>
You notice the potential roadkill as it begins its journey across the vehicle-laden road.
You want to know if you should begin boiling a pot of water in anticipation of frog legs for dinner or warm up the leftover possum.
You fire up your Swamp 'Puter XL2 and quickly write a program to determine if it is possible for the frog to make it across the road or if it will be hit by a vehicle.
<p>
Examining the patch of road in front of your shack, you notice the lanes and shoulders resemble a 10 X 10 grid of squares (shown below).
You also notice that the way the frog and the vehicles are moving can be described in &quot;turns&quot;.
To determine if the frog makes it across the road, you quickly devise a set of rules:
<ol>
	<li>At the onset of a run, the frog can start in any square on row 0 (the starting shoulder).
	<li>At the onset of a run, each vehicle will occupy a square in any column, but only in rows 1-8 (the lanes).
	<li>Each turn will consist of two steps:
	<ul>
		<li>First, the frog will always remain in the same column and move one row down, towards row 9, his destination (he's not the smartest frog in the world).
		<li>Next, all the vehicles move (at the same time), <i>n</i> squares left or right, depending on which row (lane) they are in, where n is their speed (given in the input).
	To simulate more approaching vehicles, if a vehicle moves off the grid, it instead &quot;wraps around&quot; and appears from the opposite side.
	Ex: In the grid below, if a vehicle would move to occupy column -1, it would instead occupy column 9 (column -2 would instead occupy column 8, etc.).
	Also, if a vehicle would move to occupy column 10, it would instead occupy column 0 (column 11 would instead occupy column 1, etc.).

    ----------

	</ul>
	<li>The frog will succeed in crossing the interstate for a run if it can reach row 9 (without becoming roadkill) after a series of turns starting in ANY column on row 0 (he's not the dumbest frog in the world, either).
	<li>The frog will become roadkill if at any point it occupies the same square as a vehicle. This includes:
	<ul>
		<li>The frog moving into a square a vehicle occupies, or
		<li>A vehicle &quot;running over&quot; the frog by moving over or into a square the frog occupies.
	</ul>
</ol>
<p>
<b><u>Input</u></b>
<p>
Input to this problem will consist of a (non-empty) series of up to 100 data sets.
Each data set will describe the starting conditions of the interstate for a run and will be formatted according to the following description.
There will be <b>no blank lines</b> separating data sets.
<ol>
	<li><i>Start line</i> - A single line, &quot;<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>START</span>&quot;
	<li>The next 8 lines will represent rows 1-8 (the &quot;lanes&quot; of the interstate), starting with row 1.
	Each line will consist of 10 integers, separated by single spaces.
	Each integer will represent a column for that row and will be either:
	<ul>
		<li><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>0</span>, representing no vehicle occupying that square, or
		<li>a non-zero integer <i>N</i> in the range 1 &lt;= <i>N</i> &lt;= 9, representing a vehicle is occupying that square and the non-zero integer is its speed.
		NOTE: The given speeds will NOT result in vehicles moving over other vehicles or into a square occupied by another vehicle (no accidents), since all the vehicles move at the same time and all vehicles on a given row are guaranteed to move at the same speed. 
	</ul>
	<li><i>End line</i> - A single line, &quot;<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>END</span>&quot;
</ol>
<p>
<b><u>Output</u></b>
<p>
Output for each data set will be exactly one line of output.
The line will either be &quot;<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>LEFTOVER POSSUM</span>&quot; or &quot;<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>FROGGER</span>&quot; (both all caps with no whitespace leading or following).
<p>
&quot;<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>LEFTOVER POSSUM</span>&quot; will appear if the frog can make it safely (without becoming roadkill) across the interstate after a series of turns starting in ANY column on row 0.
<p>
&quot;<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>FROGGER</span>&quot; will be output for a data set if it fails to meet the criteria for a &quot;<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>LEFTOVER POSSUM</span>&quot; line.
