Polynomial Factoring

A polynomial in x of degree D can be written as:

a_D x^D + a_D-1 x^D-1 + ... + a_1 x^1 + a_0

In some cases, a polynomial of degree D can also be written as the product of two polynomials of degrees D1 and D2, where D = D1 + D2. For instance,

4 x^2 + 11 x^1 + 6 = (4 x^1 + 3) * (1 x^1 + 2)

In this problem, you will be given two polynomials, denoted F and G. Your task is to find a polynomial H such that G * H = F, and each a_i is an integer.

Input

You should first read an integer N = 60, the number of test cases. Each test case will start by describing F and then describe G. Each polynomial will start with its degree 0 = D = 20, which will be followed by D+1 integers, denoting a_0, a_1, ... , a_D, where -10000 = a_i = 10000. Each polynomial will have a non-zero coefficient for it's highest order term.

Output

For each test case, output a single line describing H. If H has degree D_H, you should output a line containing D_H + 1 integers, starting with a_0 for H. If no H exists such that G*H=F, you should output "no solution".
