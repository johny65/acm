N-Factorful

A number is called n-factorful if it has exactly n distinct prime factors. Given positive integers a, b, and n, your task is to find the number of integers between a and b, inclusive, that are n-factorful. We consider 1 to be 0-factorful.

Input

Your input will consist of a single integer T followed by a newline and T test cases. Each test cases consists of a single line containing integers a, b, and n as described above.

Output

Output for each test case one line containing the number of n-factorful integers in [a, b].

Constraints
T = 20
1 = a = b = 107
0 = n = 10
